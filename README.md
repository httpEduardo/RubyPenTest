pentest-machine
------
Automates some pentesting work via an nmap XML file. As soon as each command finishes it writes its output to the terminal and the files in output-by-service/ and output-by-host/. Runs fast-returning commands first. Please send me protocols/commands/options that you would like to see included.

#### Installation
```
./setup.sh
source pm/bin/activate
```

#### Usage
Read from Nmap XML file

```sudo ./pentest-machine -x nmapfile.xml```


Perform an Nmap scan with a hostlist then use those results
The Nmap scan will do the top 1000 TCP ports and the top 100 UDP ports along with service enumeration
It will save as pm-nmap.[xml/nmap/gnmap] in the current working directory

```sudo ./pentest-machine -l hostlist.txt```


Skip the patator bruteforcing and all SIP and HTTP commands
-s parameter can skip both command names as well as protocol names

```sudo ./pentest-machine -s patator,sip,http -x nmapfile.xml```
